# Personify

With the current world environment, increased use of streaming means that trends are changing faster then ever. We wanted to give people the ability to understand more about their music listening habits. So, we create da fun way to visualize music taste and analyze users Spotify patterns. 

It retrieves user data through the Spotify Web API and parses the data for top ten songs recently listened to and features of those songs such as dance ability, tempo, and loudness. These are displayed on a webpage for the user to look over.
